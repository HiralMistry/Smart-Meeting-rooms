Overview
===

This project is all about making the meeting rooms smarter which automatically turns ON the lights if required and controls the room temperature if a person is present in the room. It automatically turns OFF lights and AC/Heater if nobody is present in the room. 
It is a type of finite state machine and the complete operation can be achieved by using elma (Event Loop Management) and finite state machines.

I am going to implement this code on Raspberry Pi.

The project can be considered complete once I have tests for each of the events such as 
- Temperature changes
- Motion detected
- No motion for certain time
